# IEC62443 Compliance as Code
Infrastructure-as-Code and Policy-as-Code patterns for implementing and evidencing IEC 62443 security requirements in industrial and OT environments.

## Purpose

This repository provides a structured, automatable approach to aligning systems and architectures with the IEC 62443 series by:
- Defining zones and conduits as code
- Mapping technical controls to IEC 62443 requirements
- Generating machine-verifiable evidence
- Supporting continuous compliance validation
- Enabling secure SDLC and infrastructure deployment pipelines

The goal is to treat compliance as a repeatable engineering outcome, not a manual audit exercise.

## Scope

This repository supports:
- Zone & conduit modeling
- Control intent documentation
- Security requirement traceability
- Evidence tracking via IDs
- CI/CD validation workflows
- Infrastructure compliance automation

It is intentionally generic and sanitized for use in public repositories.

Sensitive diagrams, configurations, and audit artefacts should be stored privately and referenced via Evidence IDs only.

## Standards Alignment

This project aligns with the IEC 62443 series, including:
- IEC 62443-2-x – Security program requirements
- IEC 62443-3-2 – Risk assessment & system requirements
- IEC 62443-3-3 – System security requirements and security levels
- IEC 62443-4-x – Component and development requirements

The repository structure is designed to support traceability between:

## Design Principles
	•	Zero Trust between zones
	•	Explicitly defined conduits
	•	Least privilege enforcement
	•	Strong authentication & authorization
	•	Segmentation & protocol allowlisting
	•	Auditability by design
	•	Immutable infrastructure patterns
	•	Continuous verification

## Zones & Conduits Model

Security architecture is defined using a zone-and-conduit model:
	•	Zones represent trust boundaries
	•	Conduits define controlled communication paths
	•	Each conduit includes:
	•	Purpose
	•	Allowed services
	•	Security controls
	•	Evidence references

  IT -->|C-01 Auth| DMZ
  DMZ -->|C-05 Supervised Control| OT

🧾 Control Traceability

Each control includes:
	•	Control ID
	•	IEC 62443 reference
	•	Security Level target
	•	Technical implementation
	•	Validation method
	•	Evidence ID(s)

## Automation Approach

Compliance validation can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:
	•	Infrastructure scanning
	•	Policy linting
	•	Configuration validation
	•	Drift detection
	•	Evidence artifact generation

Example workflow:

## Evidence Handling

This is a public repository.
	•	Do NOT store:
	•	Live network diagrams
	•	IP addresses
	•	Hostnames
	•	Credentials
	•	Audit artefacts
	•	Store sensitive artefacts in private storage
	•	Reference them using Evidence IDs only

## Contribution Guidelines
	•	Keep all examples generic and sanitized
	•	Avoid vendor-specific confidential details
	•	Use evidence references instead of sensitive data
	•	Maintain traceability to IEC 62443 requirements

⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository provides engineering patterns to support IEC 62443 alignment.
It does not replace formal certification, risk assessment, or third-party audit processes.
